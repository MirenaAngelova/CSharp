        //between one of the following symbols: space, “/”, “\”, “(“, “)”. First you have to export all valid usernames. 
        //A valid username starts with a letter and can contain only letters, digits and “_”. It cannot be less than 3 or 
        //more than 25 symbols long. Your task is to sum the length of every 2 consecutive valid usernames and print on 
        //the console the 2 valid usernames with biggest sum of their lengths, each on a separate line. 
        //Input
        //The input comes from the console. One line will hold all the data. It will hold usernames, divided by the symbols: 
        //space, “/”, “\”, “(“, “)”. 
        //The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
        //Output
        //Print at the console the 2 consecutive valid usernames with the biggest sum of their lengths each on a separate 
        //line. If there are 2 or more couples of usernames with the same sum of their lengths, print he left most.
        //Constraints
        //•	The input line will hold characters in the range [0 … 9999].
        //•	The usernames should start with a letter and can contain only letters, digits and “_”.
        //•	The username cannot be less than 3 or more than 25 symbols long.
        //•	Time limit: 0.5 sec. Memory limit: 16 MB.
