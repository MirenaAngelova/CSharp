        //The output consists of a paragraph, containing one of the messages in the 'Output' column in the table above.
        //Constraints
        //•	The game board will always be 4 fields wide and 4 fields high. The string for the game board contains the letter
        //combinations: P, I, F, S, V, N, or 0. The letter N is optional. All the other letters will always be on the game 
        //board. The letter combinations are separated by a space. The rows are separated by a ' | '.
        //•	The entering position will consist of two numbers, separated by a space. The first number is the row number, 
        //the second – the column number. For example '3 4' means that the entering position is row 3, column 4 
        //(indexing starts from 1).
        //•	The dice numbers are received as a string of numbers from 2 to 12, separated by a space.
        //Examples

        //Comment
        //You start on row 2, column 1 – "P". First move is 5 – you go to "F" – you are paid 20 coins, you have 70 coins now.
        //Second move is 11 – you go to "S" – you miss the next two moves – 9 and 8. 
        //Fifth move is 6 – you go to "I" – you have less than 100 coins so you pay 10 coins to sleep, you have 60 coins now.
        //Sixth move is 8 – you go to "V" – Super Vlado multiplies your coins by 10 – you have 600 coins now. 
        //Seventh move is 4 – you go to "I" – you have enough coins so you buy it – you have 500 coins now.
