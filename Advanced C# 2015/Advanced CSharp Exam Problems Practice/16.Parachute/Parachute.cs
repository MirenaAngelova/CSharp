        //You find yourself in training for becoming the best parachute jumper in the world. At the beginning of the 
        //training you need to understand how gravity and wind work. You are given all the data from previous jumps 
        //of your colleagues. Your task is to determine how the jumper will finish his jump and where he will land exactly,
        //based on the gravity and wind parameters.
        //You are given a layout, consisting of several input strings, representing a matrix. The jumper can be anywhere 
        //in the matrix and is denoted by the "o" symbol. You need to determine the movement of the jumper in iterations. 
        //On each iteration, the jumper first moves one line down, pulled by gravity. Additionally, the jumper moves 
        //sideways by the wind on the current line.
        //•	The ">" symbol means the wind is moving the jumper one position to the right. 
        //•	The "<" symbol means the wind is moving the jumper one position to the left.
        //The total direction of the wind on a single line may stack (e.g. ">>>" moves the jumper 3 positions to the right; 
        //"><<" moves the jumper 1 position to the left).
        //See the examples to better understand the motion of the jumper. 
        //The jumper can move only through air (the "-", ">" and "<" symbols). When the jumper hits the ground, 
        //water or a cliff, the jump is finished and you need to print the outcome of the jump.
        //When checking for a collision, you need to take into account only the destination cell in the matrix 
        //(do not check the path the jumper took to get there).
        //Input
        //•	The input will be read from the console.
        //•	It consists of strings, representing the rows of the matrix. The symbols are not separated by anything. 
        //•	The input ends with the keyword "END". 
        //•	The input data will always be valid and in the format described. 
        //Output
        //The output consists of two lines. The first line holds a string. There are 3 possible outcome messages:
        //•	If you have landed on the ground ("_" symbol), you are well and alive: "Landed on the ground like a boss!"
        //•	If you have landed in the water ("~" symbol), you have drowned: "Drowned in the water like a cat!"
        //•	If you have landed on a cliff ("/", "\" or "|" symbol), you have died: "Got smacked on the rock like a dog!
        //The second line holds the position (the row and col) of your landing.
        //Constraints
        //•	The row and col of the matrix will be in the range [0 … 20].
        //•	The jumper will never fly off the map.
        //•	Time limit: 0.1 sec. Memory limit: 16 MB.
