        //Vladi loves a lot to play volleyball. However, he is a programmer now and he is very busy. 
        //Now he is able to play only in the holidays and in the weekends. Vladi plays in 2/3 of the holidays 
        //and each Saturday, but not every weekend – only when he is not at work and only when he is not going to his hometown.
        //Vladi goes at his hometown h weekends in the year. The other weekends are considered “normal”. 
        //Vladi is not at work in 3/4 of the normal weekends. When Vladi is at his hometown, he always plays volleyball 
        //with his old friends once, at Sunday. In addition, if the year is leap, Vladi plays volleyball 
        //15% more times additionally. We assume the year has exactly 48 weekends suitable for volleyball.
        //Your task is to write a program that calculates how many times Vladi plays volleyball (rounded down to the nearest 
        //integer number).
        //Input
        //The input data should be read from the console. It consists of three input values, each at separate line:
        //•	The string “leap” for leap year or “normal” for year that is not leap.
        //•	The number p – number of holidays in the year (which are not Saturday or Sunday).
        //•	The number h – number of weekends that Vladi spends in his hometown.
        //The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
        //Output
        //•	The output data must be printed on the console.
        //•	On the only output line you must print an integer representing how many times Vladi plays volleyball for a year.
        //Constraints
        //•	The numbers p is in range [0...300] and h is in range [0…48].
        //•	Allowed working time for your program: 0.25 seconds.
        //•	Allowed memory: 16 MB.
        //Examples

        //5                     • 2 hometown weekends  2 Sundays  2 plays
        //2	                    • 46 normal weekends  46 * 3 / 4  34.5 plays
        //                  5 holidays  5 * 2/3  3.33 plays
        //                  Leap year  additional 15% * 39.83  5.97 plays
