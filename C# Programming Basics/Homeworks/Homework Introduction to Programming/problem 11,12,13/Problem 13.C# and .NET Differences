The C# Language and the .NET Platform 
The first version of C# was developed by Microsoft between 1999 and 2002 and was officially released to
the public in 2002 as a part of the .NET platform. The .NET platform aims to make software development 
for Windows easier by providing a new quality approach to programming, based on the concepts of the 
"virtual machine" and "managed code". At that time the Java language and platform reaped an enormous 
success in all fields of software development; C# and .NET were Microsoft’s natural response to the Java 
technology.
