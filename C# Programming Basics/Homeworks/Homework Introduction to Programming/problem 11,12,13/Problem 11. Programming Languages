Problem 11. Programming Languages

Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with information about the most
popular programming languages. How similar are they to C#? How do they differ from C#? Write in a text file
called “programming-languages.txt” at least five languages along with 2-3 sentences about each of them. Use 
English.

The biggest climbers in the TIOBE index compared to last year are C++(+1.89), C#(+1.52)and Visual Basic.NET
(+1.70). These three programming languages are also the key languages of Microsoft's Visual Studio.
Microsoft's Visual Studio is one of the few commercial programming enviroments that stood the test of time.
Together with Eclipse it is one of the most frequently used IDE's in industry.

Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurent, class-based, object-oriented, 
and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as posssible, meaning  that compiled
Java code can run on all platforms that support Java virtual machine regardless of computer architecture.
The language derives much of it's syntax from C# and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either 
of them.

C is general-purpose, imperative computer programming language. It supports structured programming, lexical
variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, 
C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found 
lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded is assembly language, uncluding operating system,
as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems. Many
later languages have borrowed directly or indirectly from C, including C++, D, Go, Rust, Java, JavaScript, 
Limbo, LPC, C#, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python, Verilog, and Unix's C shell.

C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming 
features, while also providing the ficilities for low-level manipulation.

C# is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional,
generic, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft
within it's .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma and ISO. C# is one of the programming 
languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.

Python is an open source programming language that was made to both look good and be easy to read. Python
is an interpreted language that allows the programmer to give the source code to the computer and the com-
puters runs the code right away.

What's similar between C# and Java?
Both C# and Java have built-in garbage collection, and they are Type-Safe Languages, "Pure" Object-Oriented
Languages. C# and Java allow only single inheritance, both have built-in thread and synchronization support
in their language specifications. Both have support for format exception handling, like C++, both use only
Unicode.

What's different between C# and Java?
C# and Java have different exception handling rules. Java will run on "any" operating system, C# compiled
to MSIL. C# is a more complex language than Java. Comparing the keywords is C# and Java gives insight into
major differences in the languages, from an application developer's perspective. C# allows indexers on 
classes, while Java does not. Structs are allowed in C# but not Java. "Foreach/in" is supported in C# but 
not Java.
