        //Their bottom-left corner is located at the coordinates (0, 0). See the figure (for h = 2) to get a better idea.
        //Write a program that enters a size h and 5 points {x1, y1}, {x2, y2}, {x3, y3}, {x4, y4}, and {x5, y5} 
        //and prints for each of the points whether it is inside or outside of the building. 
        //Points at the building's border, like {0, 0}, are considered inside.
        //Input
        //The input data should be read from the console.
        //•	At the first line an integer number h specifying the size of the building will be given.
        //•	At the next 10 lines the numbers x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, x5, y5 are given.
        //The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
        //Output
        //The output should be printed on the console. It should consist of exactly 5 lines. 
        //At each line print either "inside" or "outside" depending of where each of the 5 input points are located.
        //Constraints
        //•	All numbers in the input will be integers in the range [-1000 … 1000].
        //•	Allowed working time for your program: 0.1 seconds.
        //•	Allowed memory: 16 MB.
