        //Lelia Vanche is a very keen freelance developer. She is well known for her outstanding skills, but she is 
        //also known for being pretty moody, which often affects her productivity. She also has a passion for bicycles 
        //and 10% of the normal work days she goes mountain-biking instead of working.
        //You are asked to calculate whether Lelia Vanche can finish a project on time. You will be given the number of 
        //hours required to finish the project, the days that Lelia Vanche has available for working 
        //(mind that she goes to biking in 10% of this time) and her average productivity during the given period.
        //Assume that a normal work day for Lelia Vanche has 12 hours. Note that only the whole hours are taken 
        //(e.g. 6.98 hours is rounded down to 6 hours).
        //Input
        //Input data should be read from the console. 
        //•	The number h (the required work hours to finish the project) is on the first input line.
        //•	The number d (the days available to finish the project) is on the second input line.
        //•	The number p (the productivity in percent) is on the third input line.
        //The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
        //Output
        //The output data must be printed on the console.
        //•	On the first output line you should print ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ if Lelya Vanche can complete the project.
        //•	On the second output line you should print the difference, between the project hours and the work hours.
        //Constraints
        //•	The number h will be an integer between 0 and 2 147 483 647, inclusive.
        //•	The number d will be an integer between 0 and 89 478 485, inclusive.
        //•	The number p will be an integer between 0 and 100, inclusive.
        //•	Allowed working time for your program: 0.1 seconds.
        //•	Allowed memory: 16 MB.
        //Examples
        //Input	Output	Comments
        //60    No      The project requires 40 hours. Lalia Vanche has 6 days, of which 10% she will be biking,
        //6     -12	    so she will work 5.4 days * 12 hours = 64.8 hours * 75% productivity = 48.6 efficient work hours,
        //75	        which is rounded down to 48. She will be able to complete the project.
        //              The difference is 60 - 48 = -12 (she needs more 12 hours).
