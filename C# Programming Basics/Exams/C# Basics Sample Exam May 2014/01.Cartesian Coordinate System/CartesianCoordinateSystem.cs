        //You are given a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system and the two coordinates (X and Y) 
        //of a point in the coordinate system. If you don't know what Cartesian coordinate system is Google it with Bing. 
        //As you will find, the coordinate system is divided by 2 lines (see the picture bellow) which divide the plain 
        //in four parts. Each of these parts has a lot of points that are numbered between 1 and 4. There is one point 
        //where our lines are crossing. This point has the following coordinates: X=0 and Y=0. As a result this point 
        //is numbered 0. The points on the lines are also numbered with the numbers 5 and 6 (again see the picture below).
        //Your task is to write a program that finds the number of the location of the given point in the coordinate system.
        //Input
        //•	Input data is read from the console. 
        //•	The number X stays at the first input line.
        //•	The number Y stays at the second input line.
        //•	The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
        //Output
        //•	The output data must be printed on the console.
        //•	On the only output line you must print an integer number between 0 and 6, depending on the location 
        //of the given point in the coordinate system.
        //Constraints
        //•	The numbers X and Y are numbers between -2 000 000 000 001 337 and 2 000 000 000 001 337, inclusive.
        //•	Time limit: 0.25 seconds.
        //•	Allowed memory: 16 MB.
