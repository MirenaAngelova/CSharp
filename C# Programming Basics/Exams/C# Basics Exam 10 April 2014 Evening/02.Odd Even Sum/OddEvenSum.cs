        //to the sum of the even n numbers. The first number is considered odd, the next even, the next odd again, etc. 
        //Print as result “Yes” or “No”. In case of yes, print also the sum. In case of no, print also the difference 
        //between the odd and the even sums.
        //Input
        //The input data should be read from the console.
        //•	The first line holds an integer n – the count of numbers.
        //•	Each of the next 2*n lines holds exactly one number.
        //The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
        //Output
        //•	The output must be printed on the console.
        //•	Print “Yes, sum=S” where S is the sum of the odd n numbers in case of the sum of the odd n numbers is equal 
        //to the sum of the even n numbers.
        //•	Otherwise print “No, diff=D” where D is the difference between the sum of the odd n numbers and the sum 
        //of the even n numbers. D should always be a positive number.
        //Constraints
        //•	The number n is integer in range [0...500].
        //•	All other numbers are integers in range [-500 000 ... 500 000].
        //•	Allowed working time for your program: 0.25 seconds.
        //•	Allowed memory: 16 MB.
